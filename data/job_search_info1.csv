<p>You love web application development and you enjoy seeing businesses grow. You've been in the business for a few years now. You’ve done the whole startup thing and you're ready to find something a little more meaty. Working as one of many developers isn't appealing to you anymore and the commute to San Francisco isn't doing it for you either. You're ready to be part of a team, and you want to own the product vision. You love making great things used by people, not just creating code, but contributing and leading projects to success.</p>
<p>Helio has shown 20% quarter over quarter sales growth, and we need a senior engineer to shape and grow <a href=""http://helio.app/"">our Helio platform</a>.

Other days you will be deep into code, addressing architecture or fixing a tricky bug. All the while, working with the team to galvanize the momentum we’ve created with our customers.</p>
<p>You’ll work with our awesome team to learn Progressive Design — ZURB’s flagship design process — and how it applies to Helio. At the end of the day, you'll find that you are more than just a developer, you’re working with a world-class design organization, helping millions of people design for people and making a difference in the product community -- and that's pretty awesome.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Bring To The Table</strong></h3>

<li>Experience delivering solid products over and over again.</li>
<li>An enthusiasm for coaching and teaching people on our team.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>A little more about us</strong></h3>
<p>ZURB is a close-knit product design team based in Campbell, CA. We've been around since 1998, have helped more than 500 startups design some kick-ass online products and created many of our own products, like Foundation.
