<p>For additional context we might ask you to spend 2 weeks researching and building a prototype of an integration of a new Canopy partner, or to spend a week researching and building a prototype for a new compliance based need.</p>
<p>Our goal is to work with you to provide an ordered list of challenges that we need solved, and for you to work autonomously to accomplish those goals.</p>
