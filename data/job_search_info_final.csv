You’ve done the whole startup thing and you're ready to find something a little more meaty. Working as one of many developers isn't appealing to you anymore and the commute to San Francisco isn't doing it for you either.

<p>You’ll work with our awesome team to learn Progressive Design — ZURB’s flagship design process — and how it applies to Helio. At the end of the day, you'll find that you are more than just a developer, you’re working with a world-class design organization, helping millions of people design for people and making a difference in the product community -- and that's pretty awesome.</p>

Stride Consulting,"New York, New York",Full Time,Software Engineer,"<p>Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’ll be in great company.</p>
<p>Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients’ development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.</p>
<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.</p>
<p><strong>As a Strider, you’ll find a learning opportunity that’s unmatched. You will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain’s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.</li>
<li>Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>
<li>Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer</strong></p>
<p>You’ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.</p>
<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:</p>
<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.</p>
<p>10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.</p>
<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>
<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>
<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>
<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.</p>
<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>
<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>
<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>

Constructive,New York City,Full Time,"Technology Team Lead, Design Agency for Social Impact",,http://www.constructive.co,,40.742185,-73.992602
Constructive,New York City,Full Time,"Technology Team Lead, Design Agency for Social Impact","<p>Constructive (<a href=""https://constructive.co"">https://constructive.co</a>), a leading brand experience design &amp; digital design agency that works exclusively with social impact organizations is looking for an outstanding technical expert and creative thinker to take over for our current Technology Team Lead, who will sadly be transitioning out of the role at the end of 2018 to live abroad.</p>
<p>If you’re an experienced technologist who wants to work on websites and products that are at the front of the field, knows how to architect and build complex websites, thrives on being a consultative, collaborative problem solver, and believes that the best digital experiences happen when strategy, technology, and design work together, then we’d love to hear from you. If you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want the work you do to make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.</p>
<p>##A bit about the role
Our Technology Team Lead needs a holistic understanding of modern web development techniques and infrastructure. They need experience building strong and scalable websites. They must thrive on being hands-on with development projects. They’ll need a leadership mindset, and must be capable of working on multi-disciplinary teams to communicate complex technological choices to non-developers.</p>
<p>That’s all fancy job-posting language for: you really know your stuff and don’t have a big ego, you take responsibility for the quality of our work and the growth of your team, you still like to get your hands dirty with code, and you’re an effective collaborator—especially with people who don’t understand technology as well as you do.</p>
<p>##A bit about us
We’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We’ve got high expectations and we’ve got the work ethic to match them. We’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.</p>
<p>##A bit about diversity
We believe strongly that diversity is one of our greatest strengths—that the more perspectives we bring to the mix, the better we are as people and the better partner we are for our clients. So, in considering if Constructive is a good fit for you, know that all we care about is that you’re qualified to do the job, share most or all of our values, and want to be here. These are the things we’ll be evaluating for every applicant—and if you meet those and add to our diversity, all the better.</p>
<p>##What we need you to do extremely well
This role combines technology team leadership and hands-on development, emphasizing one or the other at any given time. We’ll need you to have strong demonstrated success having done all or most of these things for at least 3-5 years—and a passion for doing them well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Provide strong technical leadership</strong>—both for our internal team of developers, strategists, and designers; and for our clients and occasional external dev partners.
Manage and mentor junior developers—two in-house developers, one ongoing external partner, and any additional developers when project load requires it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Guide development team</strong> and our company on planning, prioritizing, mitigating risks, and balancing technical debt to meet project milestones so that we deliver exceptional work that meets expectations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work with stakeholders to define strategic goals</strong> and the context in which they need to be met, gather requirements, and produce technical documentation that makes it very clear how technology will help achieve them.</li>
<li>

Constructive,New York City,Full Time,"Technology Team Lead, Design Agency for Social Impact","<p>Constructive (<a href=""https://constructive.co"">https://constructive.co</a>), a leading brand experience design &amp; digital design agency that works exclusively with social impact organizations is looking for an outstanding technical expert and creative thinker to take over for our current Technology Team Lead, who will sadly be transitioning out of the role at the end of 2018 to live abroad.</p>
<p>If you’re an experienced technologist who wants to work on websites and products that are at the front of the field, knows how to architect and build complex websites, thrives on being a consultative, collaborative problem solver, and believes that the best digital experiences happen when strategy, technology, and design work together, then we’d love to hear from you. If you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want the work you do to make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.</p>
<p>##A bit about the role
Our Technology Team Lead needs a holistic understanding of modern web development techniques and infrastructure. They need experience building strong and scalable websites. They must thrive on being hands-on with development projects. They’ll need a leadership mindset, and must be capable of working on multi-disciplinary teams to communicate complex technological choices to non-developers.</p>
<p>That’s all fancy job-posting language for: you really know your stuff and don’t have a big ego, you take responsibility for the quality of our work and the growth of your team, you still like to get your hands dirty with code, and you’re an effective collaborator—especially with people who don’t understand technology as well as you do.</p>
<p>##A bit about us
We’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We’ve got high expectations and we’ve got the work ethic to match them. We’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.</p>
<p>##A bit about diversity
We believe strongly that diversity is one of our greatest strengths—that the more perspectives we bring to the mix, the better we are as people and the better partner we are for our clients. So, in considering if Constructive is a good fit for you, know that all we care about is that you’re qualified to do the job, share most or all of our values, and want to be here. These are the things we’ll be evaluating for every applicant—and if you meet those and add to our diversity, all the better.</p>
<p>##What we need you to do extremely well
This role combines technology team leadership and hands-on development, emphasizing one or the other at any given time. We’ll need you to have strong demonstrated success having done all or most of these things for at least 3-5 years—and a passion for doing them well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Provide strong technical leadership</strong>—both for our internal team of developers, strategists, and designers; and for our clients and occasional external dev partners.
Manage and mentor junior developers—two in-house developers, one ongoing external partner, and any additional developers when project load requires it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Guide development team</strong> and our company on planning, prioritizing, mitigating risks, and balancing technical debt to meet project milestones so that we deliver exceptional work that meets expectations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Work with stakeholders to define strategic goals</strong> and the context in which they need to be met, gather requirements, and produce technical documentation that makes it very clear how technology will help achieve them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Develop requirements, specifications, and architecture</strong> to document what we’re building and what’s been built.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lead development of ambitious digital products,</strong> serving as the point person for both the end-to-end process and the outcomes we deliver, aligning our work with Constructive’s broader strategic position as a leading brand experience design firm.</li>

<p>Constructive, a leading brand experience design &amp; digital design agency that works exclusively with social impact organizations is looking for an outstanding technical expert and creative thinker to join our team as a Sr. Web Developer.</p>
<p>If you’re an experienced technologist who has demonstrated expertise building Wordpress websites that demand a high degree of creative and technical complexity, thrive on being a collaborative problem solver, and believe that the best digital experiences happen when strategy, technology, and design work together, then we’d love to hear from you. And if you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want to work on interesting projects that make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.</p>
<p><strong>A bit about the role</strong></p>
<p>Sr. Web Developers at Constructive need great expertise both in creating powerful back-end publishing systems and in elegant front-end digital experiences. They need to write code that’s semantically sound and adheres to current best practices. They must be proactive thinkers who are always looking to bring new ideas to the table and improve how we work. And they must thrive on working collaboratively in multi-disciplinary teams.</p>
<p><strong>A bit about us</strong></p>
<p>We’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We have high expectations and the work ethic to match them. And we’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and a lot of joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.</p>
<p><strong>A bit about diversity</strong></p>

These are the things we’ll be evaluating for every applicant.</p>
