# COVID Unemployment Toolbox

COVID-19 has brought a significant amount of economic downfall along with it, including unemployment for many. In order to help those who have lost their jobs and are on the lookout for a job/ other resources, we have created a COVID Unemployment Toolbox!
Our web app includes a job search feature that allows users to find job matches based on user input (i.e location preferences, job title, industry, job type, etc) and pinpoint them on a map; we have also included a way for users to easily, quickly and effectively find unemployment resources in their state. 

When searching for jobs, we found that many job search engines lack fast visual navigation features, which is exactly what we have provided for users in the COVID Unemployment Toolbox. During our research, we also found that there are various unemployment resources that many are completely unaware of; these benefits vary by state, so our goal is to bring light to these resources and make it easy for people all over the nation to find them all in one place. A *key differentiator* between our project and an ordinary job hunt tool is that in addition to a job hunt feature, we have implemented a quick, user-friendly method of searching for and filtering unemployment benefits.
